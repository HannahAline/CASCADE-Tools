Overview
--------
This ArcGIS Pro Python Toolbox calculates dune offsets (shoreline-to-dune crest distances) within each CASCADE model domain. 
Dune offsets are key parameters for simulating overwash, dune migration, and barrier island evolution in CASCADE.

Toolbox Name:
    cascade_domain_dune_offset.pyt

Tool Name:
    Calculate Dune Offsets by Domain

Functionality
-------------
The tool performs the following steps:
1. Identifies dune crest locations along transects within each domain.
2. Measures the horizontal distance (offset) from the shoreline baseline to the nearest dune crest point.  
3. Associates dune offsets with the unique domain "ID" field.  
4. Outputs a CSV file of offsets for all transects and domains.

Inputs
------
- **Domain Polygons (Feature Layer)**  
  Polygon layer with a unique "ID" field for each rectangular domain.  

- **Transects (Feature Layer)**  
  Line features (e.g., 100 m spacing) extending across the barrier island.  

- **Shoreline Baseline (Feature Layer)**  
  Baseline feature used for shoreline reference.  

- **Dune Crest Features (Feature Layer)**  
  Point or line features representing dune crest locations.  

- **Output Folder (Folder)**  
  Directory where the dune offset CSV file will be saved.  

Outputs
-------
- **dune_offset_summary.csv**  
  A CSV file with the following fields:  
    - DomainID  
    - TransectID  
    - DuneOffset (shoreline-to-dune crest distance in meters)  

Example Workflow
----------------
Run this tool after generating transects and dune crest datasets. 
By repeating the analysis with DEMs and shorelines from different years, researchers can assess long-term changes in dune position and shoreline-dune spacing across domains.
